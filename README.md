## Welcome to my NMIXperts GitHub Page

I will be using this page to provide a tutorial on setting up a GitHub Pages website. This tutorial is made part in thanks to Dr. Emuel Aldridge and part in thanks to Jorrin Thacker who provided the inspiration to create this tutorial.

This website is being made as part of the Deliverables for the NMIXperts program initiated by the University of Georgia's New Media Institute at the Grady College of Journalism & Mass Communication

```### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

```For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rrohit95/nmixperts/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
