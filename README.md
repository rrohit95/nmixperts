## Welcome to my NMIXperts GitHub Page

I will be using this page to provide a tutorial on setting up a GitHub Pages website. This tutorial is made part in thanks to Dr. Emuel Aldridge and part in thanks to Jorrin Thacker who provided the inspiration to create this tutorial.

This website is being made as part of the Deliverables for the NMIXperts program initiated by the University of Georgia's New Media Institute at the Grady College of Journalism & Mass Communication
